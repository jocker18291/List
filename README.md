# List
This project involves the implementation of three data structures in C++:
1. **Dynamic Array (ArrayList)** - an array with an initial size that doubles its capacity when it runs out of space.
2. **Singly Linked List** - a list based on `head` and `tail` pointers.
3. **Doubly Linked List** - a list where each node stores pointers to both the previous and next elements.

Each of the above structures will be analyzed for performance with the following operations:
* **Adding an element**
  - At the beginning of the structure
  - At the end of the structure
  - At a random position
* **Removing an element**
  - From the beginning of the structure
  - From the end of the structure
  - From a random position
* **Searching for an element**
  - Generating a random number and checking if it exists in the structure
